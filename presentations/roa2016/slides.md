# Opensource Survival Guide

## Mike Moore - @blowmage

![Mike Moore](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/730?v=3&s=400)


---


### How to contribute, and get contributions, to opensource


---


## 3 Types of Users

1. Maintainers
1. Collaborators
1. Consumers

```notes
good to understand interactions of these levels
```


---


## Dryfus Model of Skill Acquisition

1. Novice
2. Competence
3. Proficiency
4. Expertise
5. Mastery

```notes
applies to many professions, example of Nurse.
novice - rigid rules, recitation
competence - Situational perception, all work equally imporant
proficiency - "Coping with Crowdedness" (able to do more, so more to do)
  * Actions in relation to goals
  * Start with planning, creating routines
expertise
  * Holistic view of problem space
  * Implement prioritization
  * Follow own path through routines
mastery
  * Trancend reliance on rules, guidelines
  * Deep, tacit understanding
  * Based on experience, instinct
  * More about what is possible, not what is known
  * Analytical approach
```


---


* Can typically only teach down 1 or two levels from your current level
  * Just hard to know/empathise with context and view of problem
  * So, effort to document and teach, so each level can teach the next


---


## Opensource Documentation

* README
  * make sure about introduction, top level usage
* rubydoc
  * largely only important to maintainers/contributors, advanced users
* guides
* screencasts
* code examples


---


## Encourage Contribution

* Add a CONTRIBUTING file and explain dev setup, contacting maintainers, runing tests, code convetions/style
* rubocop, CI, issue labels (including help wanted, easy, docs)
* vagrant/docker quick setups
* beginner friendly usergroups
* Opensource == remote work
* different skills. Imporance of technical writing, communication tone


---


## Thoughts

* Not just opensource, applies to any team, even without remote work
* Concentrate on not just justifying behavior but improving
* Step outside current situation, reconsider
* Be truthful

```notes
* "Leadership and Self Deception" book
```


---


## Ideas

* Remote Pairing - Screenhero, tmux, or just hangouts
* Team opensource contrib
  * learn how to contrib
  * get over intimidation as a group
* RubyTogether - official 501c6 trade org
  * supports bundler, rubygems, etc

```notes
* team contrib could be good teambuilding exercise (sponsored, beer)
* RubyTogether has contrib levels. supports OSS
  * notice many OSS full time hop jobs a lot - corps see OSS as useful only short time
```

# Including People
## AndrÃ© Arko - @indirect
### On Bundler team

---


## Reputations

* ruby has weird (and now inaccurate) reputation of sexist dudebros
* hard to break that, but effort to do so

```notes
old rep, maybe because of early rails groups, RTFM comments
```


---


## Inclusion, not just 'Diversity'

* ensure everyone can contribute
* no exclusion, no bias

```notes
everyone's the same on the internet only works for so long
```


---


## How to include

* Have a Code of Conduct
* Have great docs (both dev and end-user)
* Helpful issue resolution
* Customer Support is the voice of the users

```notes
Docs a common theme?  Issue resoution: respect and empathy. Look to understand, never dismiss.  CS is important part of any org
```


---


## How to involve

* specifically ask for help
* promote pairing, live help
* ask lots of questions. Be honest about whats hard


---


## Thoughts

* Similar themes to first talk, re teaching/docs
* Still a lot of relevant topics, inclusion, contribution
* https://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/

# Object Oriented Orbits
## a primer on newtonian physics
## Tobi Lehman - @habitmelon
![img](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261552?v=3)


---


* [Slides](https://github.com/tlehman/ooo)
* [Code](https://github.com/tlehman/newtonian)
* Can model 2 body, symmetrical multi-body, but others too complex.

```notes
Lots of vector math, explaining what the ruby ended up implementing.
Code pushes coordinates to websocket server, realtime rendering of positions
```

# Choices
## Ernie Miller - @erniemiller

* github.com/ernie/venture

![img](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14947?v=3&s=400)

```notes
interactive preso w/ live webapp. hard to describe, will link video.
```


---


## Choices have consequences

* consequences not good or bad, just are.
* humans have innate loss aversion, clouds choices
* Easy to get distracted from important choices
* intenionality - choose your choices, don't let them choose you

```notes
Elixir presentation framework for live interactive presos, including a full chat room.
Ernie had cancer, choices about atitude, balance, etc
```

---


## learn hard stuff

* 'thinky stuff' - ideas, not just skills
* builds scaffolds for learning more
* learn broadly

```notes
take time to learn stuff. not just what you immediately need, but more.
```


---


## How to learn (self/basics)

* MOOCS - online courses
  * coursera, ItunesU, etc.
  * video, forums, homework, tests, structured, vetted.
  * time consuming - feels like school
  * read the syllabus
  * be realistic about time
* books
  * look for exercises and online content
* Dedicated learning time
  * block off time in schedule
  * read, hack, watch videos


---


## How to learn (with others)

* Study Groups
  * using above or self-driven
  * meet regularly
  * have accountability
* talks
  * not just watch, DO talks
  * learn a topic, do a talk during/after
  * do talks, meet people, get jobs
  * do a talk on a topic you want to learn, keep it simple
* Hack week
  * team building, prototyping


---


## Thoughts

* CC Book Club -> CC Study Group
* Hack week/day
* Accountability is important

```notes
Book Club should be renamed study group, and concentrate on accountability. Again, hack week idea.  But most importantly, have accountability and goals
```

# BDD: Baby Driven Development
* Allison McMillan - @allie_p


---


## Baby <=> Development

* Know how to Google (filtering, right searches)
* Earned Dogmatism (close ears to opinions beacuse think you are expert)
* Debugging (common issues, inspecting logs (haha), reintroducing single features)
* build new features
* don't forget about happiness
* pairing is encouraged
* learning new things
* nobody really knows what they're doing

```notes
so many cute baby pics
```


---


## Conducting a study
* ongoing
* needs more single parents
* needs non-senior engineers
* other nontraditional (adopted, same sex, etc)
* @allie_p on the twitters


---


## Challenges as a parent

* being good mom,developer,employee,wife
* parents struggle to keep up
* time for projects, code challenges, for new jobs
* flexible hours
* help with empathy and patience
* small percent say hurt, but say slowed or changed (actually hurt?)
* no time to waste

```notes
even out of small responses, common themes
```


---


## Solutions

* parental leave
* work from home, creative working options
* support systems,
* train managers of parents
* realistic expectations
* normalize

```notes
good things to think about not only for management, but coworkers. also for other dependent situations
```

# How to stop hating your tests
## Justin Searls - @searls
## testdouble
![img](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79303?v=3)


---


## Why the hate?
* experimentation evolves into production code with unstructured tests
* when tests are slow, feel slave to tests

## Prevention

* through structure of tests,
* test isolation,
* better feedback


---


## Structure

* too big to fail
* too many small things
* tests that go off script
  * do 3 things - setup, invoke, verify
  * rspec-given - Given, When, Then
* hard to read
* framework
  * use available constructs (context vs describe)
* accidental creativity

```notes
  * tests make big objects even harder to deal with
  * rule of product: one more argument? double the tests
  * opposite problem - explosion of tiny tests
  * use convention, or just use whitespace, to make easier to read
  * calls out code smells
  * test code is untested. dont use logic (if/loop)
  * balance between terse and expressive
  * subject, result
  * consistency
  * point out unimportant stuff, important stuff
  * test data should be minimal, also minimally meaningful
```


---


## Isolation

* clear focus through isolation
* define types of tests (unit vs integration vs ?)
* create suites, separate out tests
* realism vs focus. cant predict unknowns
* redundant coverage
* careless mocking
* don't test the app framework

```notes
* clear rules for each type of test
* realistic tests are slower, increase focus on tested vs controlled. write targeted tests later
* thourough, but redundant. use code coverage, combine tests later
```


---


## Feedback

* Useful messages in tests
* long runs (skip/remove tests)
* false negatives erode confidence

```notes
redundant coverage, poor mocking, track failures, how long to fix, to improve suites

quick preso with lots of slides, but lots of tips and tricks.  work on test speed because less likely to skip things
```

# A Machine State of Mind
## Vaidehi Joshi - @vaidehijoshi
![img](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6921610?v=3)


---


## State Machines

* what looks like state machines
  * state or status column
  * timestamps with null values
  * start\_date and end\_date
* a directed graph
* Acts as State Machine (aasm)
  * states, callbacks.  block passed to transition only fires transition if succeeds. transition guards

```notes
compare aasm to workflow.  Not sure how change start/end to machine. how to track transistions
```

# In the Name of Whiskey
## Julia Ferraioli - @juliaferraioli
### Google Opensource + ML
![img](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/552235423372546050/7EhUsALR.jpeg)


---


## Can I hug that?

* machine learning from google tags
![imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tW13rWS.png?1)


---


## What about whiskey?

* managable dataset, objective data (location, ingredients, standardized taste notes)
* feature vector


---


## Tensorflow

* deferred execution (flow programming).  define compute graph, create tensor object -> matrices
* k-means clustering (in sdk).  k=number of groups, iterative process to converge centers
  * choice of K and initial centers important
* docker image for easy setup
* neural network
  * input -> ??? -> output
  * hidden layer - guides for choosing how many neurons, lots of math
  * training -> testing

```notes
Each in input through a neuron to output.  Lots of optimization, initialization state
```


---


## Lessons, Goals

* Been pronouncing all these different scotches incorrectly
* data collection is hard
  * wrong data is still wrong
  * need enough data
* thinking in N dimensions is tough


---


## Thoughts

* ruby for tensorflow APIs
* Try TF for recommendation boosting, offer rating, ocr?

# Crystal Programming Language
## Will Leinweber - @leinweber
![img](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1973?v=3)


---


## The Crystal Language

* heavily ruby inspired
    * classes are still open
    * modules + mixins, common ruby idioms (?, trailing if, ||=), to_proc
    * spec in stdlib
* built on llvm
    * easy to link, use standard c tools (instruments, etc)
    * pcre regex
* fully self hosted
    * all stdlib in Crystal, workbook web tool
* extra features
    * static method dispatch, generates overloads
    * explicit casting, union types, touples, abstracts, generics, macros

```notes
Lots of neat features, but still young. has been around a while, but only a few committers
```

# Why Good Software Goes Bad
## Rein Henrichs - @reinh
![img](http://i.imgur.com/03cr8D2.jpg?1)


---

## Process Patterns

* software fails a lot
* 0: oblivious - don't even know theres process, but capable of solving problem on own + 1 user
* 1. Variable - do whatever we feel in the moment - poor adherance to process
  * requires great relation with customer, competant professionals, not solving a problem too big for team
  * myth - rockstar programmer - completely dependent on individual performance


---


2. Routine - follow routines, plan to solve all problems
  * requires high level of planning, managers. problem cant be bigger than small team
  * myth - rockstar manager - repeatable, but not repeated. blindly follows process.
  * falls into some name magic - just saying 'agile, tdd, lean', and expecting powers
3. Steering pattern - choose among routines by results they produce
  * requires management training, experience, less on individual contribution
  * process not always well defined, but goals are. Can recover if process doesnt work
  * problems hard enough for simple routines to break down. Control/negotiate external

```notes
2 more levels, but in govt study, nobody gets beyond 3. 85% at 1, 1% at 3
```


---


## Cybernetic Control

* controlling inputs -> outputs via feedback loop
* controller manages requirements.
* nonlinear system, inputs don't map to outputs. Humans very hard at predicting
* deal with nonlinear - prioritize with governing actions.
    * act early, small and often
    * get visibility.  If you cant understand it, you cant fix it
* make governing model explicit
* spend time thinking about the people

```notes
implicit - devs will do what I tell them. I can add people to go faster. Bugs occur at random. The more pressure, the faster they work. I know how to identify the best developers - all characteristic of variable
Mythical Man Month
```
