# STORAGE

## Persistence -

- persistent
- transient
- Ephemeral
- Iops vs total thruput (eg big sequental files)
- Consistency
  - acid - relational, atomic consistent isolated durable
  - Base - basic available (even if stale), soft-state (may not be instantly consistent), eventual consistent

## S3

- max object 5tb - 5gb max put - recommended multipart 100mb
- Read-after-write PUT - read immediately
- HEAD and GET before object exists, eventual consistency for that key
- Eventual for PUT and DEL
- Updates to single key are atomic
- ACL, IAM, MFA before delete
- Versioning - old versions count billable
- Cross region repl- security, compliance, latency
- Lifecycle mgmt
- Data lake - Athena, spectrum, quicksight
- IOT - firehose
- Machine learning, AI, recognition, lex, mxnet
- Storage class analytics
- Encryption
  - SSE-s3 - AWS provided key
  - SSE-C upload your own key AES256
  - SSE-KMS use KMS key
- Client-side
- transfer acceleration (cloudfront in reverse)
- Requester pays (transfer & request charges)
- Tags for cost billing, security
- Events - to SNS, SQS, lambda
- Static web hosting
- BitTorrent- generates .torrent file

## Glacier

- cheap, slow, seldom access
- S3 w lifecycle management
- Faster if pay more - still slow
- Glacier vault (like bucket)
- Archive (object)
- Lock (different than access policy) - immutable - no deletes or MFA
  - Initiate - 24 hour confirm
  - Permanent by design

## EBS

- virtual hard drives - only with ec2, single AZ
- Variety of choices for iops, throughput, cost
- Snapshots
- Pay for provisioned size
- (Instance store - temporary, only available with ec2 inst, locked to inst - direct attached)
- Snapshot
  - Backups, share with other accounts, migrate to az/region, encrypt a volume
  - Snapshots are incremental - add together

## EFS

- nfs file share - nfsv4 but not all features
- Only pay for what used
- Expensive - 30x ebs, 20x s3
- Multi-az
  - Multi mount points, in az
- Can mount via direct-connect
- EFS file sync agent, on prem

## Storage Gateway

- onprem virtual machine
- Local storage but backed or synced by s3 and glacier
- DR and cloud migrations
- File gateway - nfs or smb to s3
- Volume gateway stored - gateway stored - iscsi- async replication to s3
- Volume gateway cached - gateway-cached - iscsi - primary data in s3, cached locally
- Tape gateway - gateway virtual tape library - iscsi - virtual media changer and tape for backup software
- Bandwidth throttling

## WorkDocs

- amzn version of google drive
- Integrate with AD and SSO
- Web, mobile, windows/mac
- Compliant

## Databases

- on ec2 - run anything, but manage everything yourself
- RDS - managed, structured relational
  - Drop in replacement, backups, patching
  - Scaling & replication
  - Antipatterns
    - large BLOBS - use s3
    - Automated scale - dynamo
    - Name value - dynamo / nosql
    - Not well structured - dynamo
    - Other platforms - ec2
    - Complete control - ec2
  - multi az, replicas - transactional engine (innodb, xtradb)
    - Multiaz synchronous
    - Replica async
    - Can promote read replica, manual process
- DynamoDB- Werner Vogels help write paper
  - Managed, multiaz, nosql, available cross-region
  - Eventual consistency, but request strong
  - Has acid transaction api in sdk
  - Provisioned on readwrite capacity
  - Auto scale based on existing thruput
  - On-demand capacity for a cost
  - Relational vs sql
    - Tables vs name/value
    - Partition key - hash key
    - Sort key
    - Secondary indexes
      - pick projection (view), no more than 20 unique across all indexes
- Redshift
  - Data warehouse
  - Postgres compatible
  - Parallel processing columnar data

  - Billed by nodes
  - Streaming data
  - Redis - encryption, hippa , clusterin, HA replication, pubsub, backup/restore
- Comparison
  - Ec2 - ultimate control, not on rds
  - Rds - oltp, relational
  - Ddb- name value pair
  - Redshift - big data, Olap
  - Neptune - graph
  - Elasticache - temporary

## Storage tips

- Know when to use stores
- White papers [ ]
- Reinvent videos - deep dives
- Archive and Backup good pilot
- Use s3 endpoints in VPC
- Secure s3
- Encrypt !!!
- Consider aurora
- Consider nosql
- Dbs on ec2 look like they cost less, but mgmt cost
- Can have perf hit on single az backup

## Lab Notes

- Open source data
  - Air Quality Data - Ozone levels for US
  - Find highest concentration for October 9, 2018
  - Find EBS? Mount it
  - otherwise google
  - OpenAQ data is available in S3
  - json data, extract columns we want

# NETWORKING

## Already know

- default vs local routes
- Public private
- OSI model
  - Physical, Data Link (MAC), Network (IP ARP), Transport (TCP), session (setup/tear down), presentation (ssl/this,
    compression), application (browser)
  - AWS physical, data link, (+ network?)
  - ENI = virtual data link
  - VPC does not allow multicast - layer 2 activity
  - Layer 4
  - TCP - stateful, confirmed
  - UDP - stateless, simple
  - ICMP - devices exchange info, ping
- Ephemeral Ports - >1024 - NACL and secgroups
- AZs distributed randomly per account

## Network to VPC

- managed vpn - IPSec - tunnel between routers over internet
  - Virtual gateway in VPC
- Can setup multiple conns
- direct connect - dedicated network connection
  - Big pipe - need provider
  - Create virtual interfaces to private, public services
  - Not redundant (use vpn or another dc)
- Direct connect +VPN - VPN over private line
  - Can run multiple vpn over DC
  - More secure, more complex
- VPN Cloudhub
  - Hub and spoke over private gateway
  - Simple to setup for multiple locations
- software VPN - DIY - run on ec2 inside VPC
  - Flexible and manage, on your own
- Transit VPC - some parts managed
  - Must design redundancy
  - 3rdparty

## VPC to VPC

- All of the above if you want
- peering - without going over internet
  - Transitive peering: no.
  - Peering request in API
  - Route over peer
- private link
  - Connect to services
  - Create endpoints, others acces to that endpoint over VPC for services
- VPC Endpoints
  - Gateway S3 and Dynamo - as route intercept prefix
    - policies
  - Interface - as real ENI
    - Security groups
- TODO Transit Gateway

## Internet Gateway

- inet gateway
  - Horiz scale, HA, no availability or bandwidth constraint
  - Public subsets w/ route
  - NAT for public IP
- egress-only
  - IPv6 only - prevents inbound
  - Stateful to traffic
  - Instead of NAT
- NAT instance - just ec2 AMI
  - Outbound only, not ipv6
  - Must live public subnet
  - Make default route on private subnet
- NAT gateway - fully managed
  - Public subnet, default route
  - Gateway in each AZ - 5 to 45 gbps
  - Cannot route to peering, VPN
- instance v gateway
  - Availability - gateway
  - Bandwidth - instance depends on type
  - Perf - instance is just ec2
  - Public IP - gateway cannot be detached
  - Secgroup - instance can use
  - Instance can be bastion

## Routing

- VPC - tables and BGP
- VPC can have route tables
  - Most specific wins
  - prefixlist for gateway
- BGP - dynamic routing
  - DC, optional for VPN
  - ASN assign, weights
  - Higher weight wins

## Enhanced Networking

- high perf networking
- HVM AMI (Nitro) - 10 to 25gb
- Placement groups
  - Clustered in a low latency group in az as close as possible, instance spread across underlying hardware farther
    apart
  - Clustered low latency, spread reduce risk of simultaneous failure
  - Spread can span azs
  - Clustered have finite capacity, spread max of 7 per group per AZ

## Route 53

- policies
- Simple
- Failover - use health
- Geolocation - country/state
- Geoproximity - near to region + bias
- Latency - which resource has lower (to AWS)
- Multivalue - several IPs
- Weighted - distribute responses - weight/sum

## CloudFront

- CDN, static and live streaming
- Default cert = cloudfront.net
- ACM or custom cert
- Dedicated IPs for ssl for a cost
- Or use SNI - old browsers donâ€™t support
- Security policy for tow version

## ELB

- ALB = layer 7 - http/s
  - Path/header routing
  - Session ID sticky
- NLB = layer 4 - TCP
  - Speed, not http
- CLB = 4(ish) or 7 - tcp, ssl, http/s
- Public or private

## Tips

- pros/cons of different onprem
- Functions of different VPN comp
- Functions of different VPC comp
- Multicast and broadcast not supported
- Direct Connect not inherently Redundant
- Stateful, connection-based
- Ephemeral ports
- BGP weighting
- Routes and priority
- VPC peering
  - Cidr range cant overlap
  - Routes must be added
  - Transitive not supported
  - Transit VPC
- gateway
  - Instance vs gateway
  - Inet gateway no constraints, nat do have constraint
  - Multiple nats
  - Egress-only for ipv6
- route53
  - Policy types
- cloudfront
  - Custom domain and SNI
- ELB
  - Different types
  - Sticky sessions, protocol
- white papers [ ]
- Reinvent talks

## Tips

- DC can be cheap when huge data
- Explicit deny via NACL and SG - least privilege
- Think through VPC design
- ELB and r53 provide abstraction

## Lab Notes - fix a bad network

- Provided cloud formation script
- Working
- Update with another cloud formation
- this is the mess
- FQDN for working web
- Do not use a change set, script or preview to cheat
- Ideas:
  - Apply and test against webserver
  - Look at NACLs, Routing, SG inbound/outbound, Internet Gateway, public IP
  - create a changeset to fix
  - apply fix
  - validaate by looking at changeset

# MIGRATIONS

## Strategies

- re-host lift&shift as is
- Re-platform lift & reshape - migrate dB to rds
- Re-purchase - migrate from on prem to saas
- Rewrite - serverless rewrite
- Retire
- Retain - do nothing
- Effort vs opportunity

## Adoption Framework

- TOGAF - architectural framewk
  - Can fill a vacuum of stds
  - Misunderstood
- cant hide behind framework
  - Not perfect, not a cookbook
- framework has tech and org and culture
- Biz - people - governance
- Platform - sec - ops

## Hybrid

- first step, pilot
- Augment & extension (VMware)
- Loosely coupled hopefully
- Storage gateway
- Middleware to specific apps
- VMware center spread wkload

## Migration Tools

- storage migration - storage Gateway and snowball
- Server migration - VMware and hyperv to AMI syncing - client
- Database migration - schema conversion tool - same or different dB - has onprem function
- App discovery svc- info about onprem data center inventory, info about running on AWS
- Project view in migration hub

## Network Migration

- ensure no ip overlaps
- First 4 IPs and last are reserved
- VPN & direct connect - use BGP for routing, dc always preferred on AWS side

#### Snow family

- bandwidth of a truck :)
- Encrypted at rest
- Import/export - ship physical drive
- Snowball - nas in a box 80tb
- Snowball edge - + lambda clustering
- Snowmobile - 100pb
- strategies, trade offs

- Hybrid - typical & VMware
- Migrations - server, storage, dB
- Network - architectures & vpn and dc

## Pro tips

- tech is a minor part
- Project mgmt discipline - milestones, gates, measurement
- Be a diplomat

## Challenge 1

- people section of cloud adoption framework: commodity to highly valued, compensation
- measure the benefits or success of cloud migration (weirdly worded)
- doesnt directly talk about accounting

## Challenge 2

- B - experiment with conversion - but SCT doesnt support nosql
- C - drop VMWare into AMIs
- D - try using DMS

# SCALE

## Concepts

- patterns
- Loosely coupled - abstraction and flexibility - atomic units
- Scale horiz vs vertical
- Match demand

## auto scaling

- maintain, manual, schedule, metric
- Health check Grace period
- Target tracking - keep metric in a range
- Simple policy - on health check and cool down
- Step scaling - on items and logic
- Cool down - chance to come up to speed, between evals

## Kinesis

- shards - 1k or 1mb per, in
  - Key and sequence
  - Seq for cursor
- Transient, 24h-7d
- Video stream

## Dynamo dB

- Efficiency is key
- Microservice and API

## Lab

- Auto Scale Experiment - proof scaling works as cost effective
- build scenario that simulates heavy load scale out
- demonstrate scale in
- idea: use SQS and target message queue length. add messages, see scale up, consume messages, see scale down
- or use artillery and a 'heavy' webpage and CPU tracking

# BUSINESS CONTINUITY

## Overview

- Biz Continuity - vs Disaster Recovery
  - HA (redundancy) vs Fault Tolerance (handle failure)
  - SLA (agreed goal or target)
  - RTO = time objective (MTTR)
  - RPO = data loss
- Categories
  - Hardware failure
  - Deploy fail
  - Load induced (DDOS)
  - Data induced (bad data)
  - Credential exp
  - Dependency failure
  - Infrastructure (fiber cut)
  - ID exhaustion (capacity or autoincrement)
  - Human error

## DR Archictures

- continuum of HA
- Backup/restore (s3/glacier/snaps)
- Pilot light - hot site minimal - requires manual intervention
- Warm standby - up and running, shadow env - can be automated, may need scaled
- Multi-site - full prod load - little to no intervention - expensive

## Storage

- EBS <0.2% fail - 99.999% avail - single az replica automatic - can snapshot to s3, regions
  - Raid - raid0 stripe, raid1 mirror, raid5 1 parity, raid 6 2 parity - nested (0+1) - 5 and 6 not recomm
  - Iops - raid0 iops added, space added - raid1 same, half space
- s3 - storage classes
  - Standard- 99.99%
  - SIA = 99.9%
  - One-z IA = 99.5%

- Memcached - no repl, but multiple nodes, across az
- Redis - multiple nodes, enable multi-az for automatic failover, backups

## Network

- subnet in multiaz (all?)
- Two paths per connect
- DC not ha - data carriers

# COST

## Concepts

- capex- long term assets purch
  - Depreciation, extend cost over many years
  - Must forecast, hard
- Opex- keep business running, variable
- TCO - including hard & soft (effort) costs
- ROI
- Full on-prem cost not well understood, including soft cost
- Learning curve of cloud
- Business plan - many assumptions

## Strategies

- appropriate provisioning - run whatâ€™s right - consolidate for density and lower complexity
- Right-sizing - lowest cost for specs
- Purchase options - RIs - spot instances for horiz - ec2 fleets
- Geo pricing selection
- Managed services- soft costs
- Data transfer - out and between $ - DC can be effective

## Tagging

- cost, security, automation, security, etc
- Enforce w/ config & scripts
- Resource groups - consoles, alarms, etc

## Spot and RI

- RI - discount, provide assured capacity, discount rate automatic on match
  - Ec2 - standard, convertible, scheduled
  - Consolidated billing
  - Can be resold
  - 1/3yr
  - Convertible can change family, benefit from price reductions
  - Type, platform, tenancy, AZ (only to that AZ, creates guarantee in that az)
  - Instance flexibility only linux regional
- spot instances - excess capacity on market
  - Define highest price willing
  - One-time - term above bid
  - Maintain - reprovision after bid, can stop/hibernate
  - Duration - finite time
  - Per AZ independent
- Dedicated instance - hardware for your account - on demand, reserved, spot - $2/hr
- Dedicated host - control of hardware (licensing). One ec2 instance type

## Tools

- budgets - limits/alarms on cost, RI util - awareness
- Consolidated billing - scale discounts (tiers, etc)
- Trusted advisor - can help
- Biz or ent plan more

## Tips

- capex vs opex
- TCO v ROI and challenges
- Cost optimization strategies
- Tagging- common uses, strategy, resource groups
- Spot RI - limitations of zone v region, spot instance how
- Tools - budgets, billing, advisor

## Pro Tips

- TCO & ROI minefield - finance
- Translate soft costs
- Agility & flexibility - not always cost - different & learning
- Long term effort
- Tag early!
- Aggressive w/ pilot project

## Quiz

- Dedicated Instances can be Spot, do not reserve capacity
