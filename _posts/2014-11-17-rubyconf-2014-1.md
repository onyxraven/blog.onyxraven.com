# Keynote - Yukihiro "Matz" - "Feeding the Sharks"
* OSS developer community like sharks
  * move or die, move somewhere else more interesting
  * History of rubyconf announcement/discussions
  * exciting new but uncertain ideas
* Ruby 3
  * (Still lots coming in 2.2)
  * Concurrency
    * GIL
  * JIT
    * LLVM?
  * Static typing
    * ?
    * Scala, Dart, Typescript, ECMA6, Go
    * (python has hints, but not checked) - mypy has optional checker
    * Performance
      * do we need static typing for speed? Maybe JIT is enough
    * Compile Time checking
      * static analysis, refactoring
    * Documentation
      * better than comments/yard
    * why not
      * duck typing
      * optional static to allow overload, but ended up a mess
      * ruby should keep being ruby, w/ duck typing
      * DRY
      * would restrict require, define_method, method_missing (meta programming)
    * -> Soft Typing
      * type inference
      * Type represented as set of methods signatures (or class/module, which are a set)
      * closer communication between compiler and user (ide) - knows methods needed
      * fallback
      * static analyzer

# Advanced - I <3 Promises in Ruby - Dinshaw Gobhai - @tallfriend
* https://github.com/dinshaw/promises-in-ruby - https://github.com/dinshaw/promises
* fn -> promise (respond_to :then) (lambdas)
* Uses Thread.new
* Fulfill and Reject
  * in promise block, call fufill if ok, call reject if rejected
  * uses method() turns method names into lambda
  * catches all errors, calls reject
* All and Any on lists of promises (from spec)
* Return a promise immediately
* fulfill or reject
* chainable

# Advanced - Letting Concurrency help you today - Richard Bishop - @rbondev
* Great language for getting feet wet in concurrency
* Concurrency about dealing with lots of things at once, Parallelism is doing a lot of things at once
* parallel - overlapping, no communiciation, concurrent - communication
* Primitives - Processes, Threads, Events
* *Threads*
* Libraries:
  * Celluloid - Actor and Object - pass messages - pools and supervisors
    * Actor -> mailbox -> messages (message queue)
    * Sidekiq -
    * Sucker_Punch - in memory
  * Puma
* Concurrent Design
* Elixr
  * Erlang VM, Concurrency as paradigm - actors and message passing
  * Supervision tree -
* (SOA) - separate processes, message queue
  * gives modularity
  * now coupled over the network, rely on reliability
* Defending ruby
* overall a bit too high level for an Advanced track talk. Wanted more actual solutions. Sounds like music would have been better (@lsegal Loren Segal)

# Future proofing your 3rd party integrations - @idlehands - Jeffery Matthias
* Sendgrid - PHP app being refactored into Ruby (not Go, lol) - PivotalLabs helped them
* Keep 3rd party logic out of our code
* Make 3rd party behavior predictable
* Make 3rd party replacable
* Adapter - just a gem.  use Gemfile ```gem '', path: 'relativepath'```
  * Still wrap your own adapter around their gem
* Clearly define internal vocabulary
* Use internal vocab, adapt to external (prefer internal as needed)
* Use Data Transfer Object (put necessary parameters, validate attributes)
* Abstract Service - make interface for the adapter
* Adadapter/Interface (gem) - separate from implementation, contains DTO and abstracts. Helps enforce generic use
* gem - uptyped - type checking etc
* use sandbox when available
* create a fake service or user VCR - has to be consistently maintained
* use dependency injection - pass the class to be used underneath
* CI should hit the sandbox / real code regularly
* Flexibility + separation of concerns
* Portability (messgage bus, etc)
  * DTO helps
  * consistent Abstract Interface

# GOING EVERGREEN - Kane Baccigalupi - @rubyghetto
* Greenfield - new and bright and interesting and easy to work with
* Brownfield - old project, ongoing maintenance
* how to get it green
* SOLID
  * Single Responsibility - should only change for one reason
  * Open / Closed - open for extension, closed for modification (inheritance)
  * Liskov (Substitution) - parent more specific than child
  * Interface segregation -
  * Dependency Inversion - high level should not depend on low level. abstractions should not depend on details (dependency injection)
  * help respond to change. rules are tightly coupled. motivated by change
  * great guidelines if you know it already
* Sandi's 5 Rules
* STD2
  * Small - small classes, small methods. easier to read
  * Test drive it
  * D2 - Dependency Inject, Law of Demeter (low communication)
* Rules dont make code, teams make code
* Code is about communication
* affective metrics (hiring)
  * communicative
  * enjoyable
  * motivated
  * self aware
    * impostor syndrome vs arrogance
    * learning style
    * impact control (how my behavior impact others)
  * design - refactoring instinct
  * faith - ?

# Fighting Bugs with Hacks - Paul Gross - @pgr0ss
* If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in - E. Dijkstra
* Testing is good for showing there are bugs, but bad at proving their absence
* Fail Fast (Martin Fowler)
* Structure systems to reduce severity
* Hazard mitigation
  * add code to check things that shouldnt be needed, but would mitigate severity of bug
  * check a few important things
  * figure out invariants of system
    * customer_id, patient_id
  * add checks, fail fast, add alert
  * scoped find hook - force 'customers' to be scoped to merchant (braintree)
    * can bypass with special parameter (safety)
* focus on validity of data
  * doublecheck calculations and allow for rerun
* write checks outside of normal flow of code
  * keep very simple
  * alerts on num transactions (old ones), high numbers, latency
* hacks at development time
* safe migrations
  * unsafemigrationerror (alias old method)
  * add/remove
  * unsafe prefix to bypass
  * TODO find gem for this?
* sanity specs
  * doublecheck ids *public_id* indexes
  * indexes on relations? automatic?
    * ```ActiveRecord.tables.indexes```
  * automated checks on crazy / dangerous operations

# Your bright metaprogramming future - Betsy Haibel \w Optoro @betsythemuffin
* not skynet or magical or perl (lol)
* code that treats the program as just data
* Object.send(method, *args)
  * sends a message to the object
  * breaks grep (hard to find cause method names are obsured)
  * cyclomatic complexity - paths that can take through code
  * limit scope of dynamic method calls, keep closer to the code its calling
* method_missing
  * need respond_to_missing
  * call super (chaining)
  * method_missing is slow by itself - define_method once found?
    * if you're gunna do this,  maybe predefine these instead
  * consider using a different paradigm
  * good for objects (OpenStruct), delegators (Delegator mixin)?
* define_method
  * performance at load is pretty slow - causes class / method table rebuild
  * wrap in a method (```define_...```) so can be tested/redefined
  * Put these into an anonymous module?
* hooks
  * normal: inherited, included, extended
  * weird: method_added, method_removed, singleton_*
  * dont?!
    * consider using a simple macro and using a separate object
