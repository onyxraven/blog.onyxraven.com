# Keynote - Sandi Metz - MADAM SANDI TELLS YOUR FUTURE
* Matz is nice and so we are nice (minaswan)
* Scroll -3000 to 0
* Romans - Codex (books) - random access. read and write at the same time
* Scriptorium - snarky comments -
* 0 to 1400 - written by hand
* 1450 - gutenberg
  * yak shaving - letter print (swort?) - wear out quickly
  * need reliable way to copy sworts
  * lost the rights
  * print shops
    * upper case and lower case
    * stereotypes - whole pages cast instead of just the individual letters
  * still set by hand. newspapers have to do it every day
* 18x linotype
  * dynamicly cast a whole line of type
  * machine to create lines of type, molds lead after lining up
  * edison called 8th wonder of the world
  * newspapers 8 to 48 pages per issue
  * newspapers actively recruited deaf employees
  * never complain about CSS again
  * worldwide literacy
* hot to cold type
* the fortune : everything will change
  * death, decay, obscelence
  * the 'happy path' of life
  * MVP - health, happyness
  * contribute
  * do for others
  * always something that needs doing

# Fringe Ruby - 2 + CATS = 4 * CUTE: HOW MATH WORKS IN RUBY - Chris Hoffman - @yarmiganosca - Optoro
* numerical coercion
* ```#coerce(numeric) -> array``` - find a common type between the two operands
  * ```1.2.coerce(3) => [3.0, 1.2]```
* Vectors - can we make these work with coerce?
  * yes, define coerce and operation(s)
* Dimensional analysis
  * gem unitary
  * size * dimension
* Other uses
  * currency manipulation (gem conversions)
  * balance chemical equations?
  * function scaling/composition

# Fringe Ruby - A PARTIAL-MULTIVERSE MODEL OF TIME TRAVEL FOR DEBUGGING - Brock Wilcox
* pry-byebug (2.0+)
* YARV bytecode
  * trace codes - hooks into VM state
* pry-timetravel
  * ```back``` to step backwards into previous state
* every next, fork and suspend the fork
* back, grab most recent child fork
* pid = fork
  * if pid parent; else child
  * $$ = current pid
* signals (OS Callbacks)
  * ```Signal.trap```
  * ```Process.kill```
  * SIGTSTP - SIGSTOP (uncatchable) - no io, etc, -> SIGCONT (continue, unstop)
* limitations
  * can only go back as far as snapshots
  * shared file handles, incl sockets
  * threads :-( - no copy of threads
  * memory exhaustion
* complication
  * shell detects stop, inside
    * fix : make dummy parent process
  * killing parent processes
    * fix : kill the others
    * except everything will have this, so force? ```Kernel.exit!```
  * zombies
    * child exited, but parent doesnt waitpid - process is dead, yet remains
    * owned by init
* snapshot tree?
  * can back to pid
* 'snap $cmd'
* autosnapshot and prune
  * autosnap every stack frame change
* other techniques
  * yarv - keep track of everything there
  * ocaml debugger does fork()
  * "why is reverse debugging rarely used" on stackexchange
  * elm-lang, watches what is changed

# JRuby 9000 - Charles Nutter @headius & Tom Enebo @tom_enebo
* Ruby on JVM
  * native threads, tooling, JIT
  * pull in any java library, ehcache, neo4j, lucene
  * other languages, scala, jython, clojure, groovy
* JRuby 1.7 == Ruby 1.8 or 1.9 - new releases frequently
* JRuby 9 == Ruby 2.2(+) - release mid Jan?
  * New runtime
  * Major IO & Encoding
* timing
  * startup time (from command line)
  * warmup time (until best performance)
  * running time (now running)
* indy (invoke dynamic) - high warmup time, lower stable time
* MRI - internal representation -> interpreter
* Jruby - internal representation -> (interpreter) -> java bytecode -> native code
* why not JIT everything? cause warmup is slow.
  * JIT creates lots of classes
  * more code for the JVM to deal with
* benchmarking
  * benchmark/ips or perfer
  * with warmup/rehearsal time
* jvm and jruby are mixed mode - interpreter -> JIT
* example
* deoptimization (undo optimizations) to try crazy optimizations and rollback if it doesnt work
* Jruby --dev (skip jit) faster warmup for dev
* Drip - new jvm for next command, like spring preloader
  * tell what to preboot, gets faster
* New runtime (IR)
  * no AST, semantic representation
  * traditional compiler design
  * no heap allocated arguments, removes extra binding
  * add jruby --debug
  * compiler optimizations (dead code, constant propogation, inlining, unboxing) - done with pluggable compiler passes
* new IO and character Transcoding (M17n)
  * MRI gives thin wrapper around fd
  * JVM gives Channel, which looks like fd
  * old Jruby emulates libc fd
  * JDK uses UTF16
  * impossible to emulate some POSIX stuff
  * new IO layer (OpenFile) - passes nearly all, performance better, match MRI
* Old JIT
  * 16k loc just for bytecode gen
  * one-off optimizations
* New JIT
  * 95% done
  * 56k loc
  * equal performance, lots of room to improve
* Memory Analysis + debugging
  * VisualVM. GC, java object level
  * Ruby-centric version
  * Alienist - java -> ruby heap dump
    * mri version?
    * size, query language?
    * allow implementation specific data
    * spec for json format
* TODOs
  * finish JIT
  * AOT compiler (jrubyc)
  * IR compile & interp speedups
  * Refinements
  * MRI test suite
* How to help
  * run master - jruby-head (in travisci)
  * openjdk8 oraclejdk8 openjdk7
  * rbenv/ruby-build jruby-9(.0.0.0)-dev
  * setup for dev - clone; mvn -Pbootstrap;
  * run tests/specs, find excluded that is fixed
  * fork, create a branch, send a PR
    * implement tagged/excluded
    * mine for bugs (Beginner tags)

# Elixr
* Thread - lots of ways to shoot self in foot
* Built on Erland VM - Erricson labs - telephone switch
* Not just a CoffeeScript for Erlang
* better tools, syntax, standardlib
* Tools
  * iex (REPL) - built in doc system, in markdown
  * mix (project mgr, create project, manage dependencies, run tests)
* pipe operator
  * data transformations - (nested fns)
* Actor concurrency model
  * "Process"
  * performs one task
  * send and receipt messages, messages are pattern matched to methods
  * unshared memory
  * Ackermann function
  * unprocessed messages are buffered (queued)
* Fault tolerance
  * supervision tree. supervisors are just processes
  * can restart processes, kill them off etc
  * keep calm and let it crash
  * supervisor heirarchy can take over and put system back together
* http load tester example
  * coordinator, create workers, track responses
  * workers just send message back with result
* task is like a future/promise
  * runs in a container.  await to gather result
* distributed
  * message passing between processes on network are transparent
* Phoenix Framework

# MY LITTLE C EXTENSION: LEGO ROBOTS ARE MAGIC - Brandon Hays
* about burnout
* how to C in ruby
  * start a gem, good guide on rubygems
  * include ruby.h
  * include c dependencies
  * magic Init_native to define module, method(s)
  * cast C types to Ruby types
  * (VALUE self) - own ruby object
  * segfaults (yay)
* wrap the rest of the API
* Style Guide
  * Keep low level like C (ugly)
  * Low level wrappers in a ::Native module
  * prefix c method helpers
* C Ext Cheat sheets (links in slides)
* atone for cheating :-)
* oh no, people are using it
* how did it help burnout?
  * just doing something for self
  * play to get <3 back
  * play is how you realize unlimited potential
