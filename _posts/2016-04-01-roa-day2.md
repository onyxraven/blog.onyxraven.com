# Baby Driven Development: BDD

* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/asheren/bdd-baby-driven-development)
* @allie_p - ongoing study and survey on dev+parenting
  * more single, non senior, adopted children

similarities

* Know how to Google (filtering, right searches)
* Earned Dogmatism (close ears to opinions beacuse think you are expert)
* Debugging (common issues, inspecting logs (haha), reintroducing single features)
* build new features
* don't forget about happiness
* pairing is encouraged
* learning new things
* nobody really knows what they're doing

challenges

* being good mom,developer,employee,wife
* parents struggle to keep up
* time for projects, code challenges, for new jobs
* flexible hours
* help with empathy and patience
* small percent say hurt, but say slowed or changed (actually hurt?)
* no time to waste

solutions

* parental leave
* work from home, creative working options
* support systems,
* train managers of parents
* realistic expectations
* normalize

### Thoughts

* good things to think about for managers, teammembers and parents
* also some just for anyone with interesting/dependent situations

# How to stop hating your tests

* Justin Searls @searls
* [Video from RubyConf](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2015-11-16-how-to-stop-hating-your-tests.html)
* why the hate?
  * experimentation -> production, some tests.  slow -> slaves to tests
* prevention
* structure, isolation, feedback
* structure
  * test files too big to fail
    * tests make big objects even harder to deal with
    * rule of product
    * one more argument? double the tests
  * too many small things!?
  * tests that go off script
    * can do 3 things - setup, invoke, verify, Given, When, Then (and)
    * call out 3 phases in tests
    * make tests clear
    * rspec-given
    * easy to read
    * calls out code smells
  * hard to read
    * test code is untested.  shouldn't have logic
    * rspec context vs describe
  * framework
    * balance between terse and expressive
  * accidental creativity
    * subject, result
    * consistency
    * point out unimportant stuff, important stuff
    * test data should be minimal, also minimally meaningful
* isolation
  * clear focus
    * define types of tests
    * create suites
    * separate out levels of abstraction
      * unit (mock) vs integration (dont mock)
      * clear rules for each level
    * too realistic
      * realistic are slower, take more time, more complex
      * increase focus on tested vs controlled
      * cant predict unknowns.  Might be able to write targeted test after
    * redundant coverage
      * thourough, but redundant
      * how detect? coverage tools - avg hits per line
      * can combine/eliminate test layers?
      * outside-in tdd
    * careless mocking
      * thoughtful isolation
      * can treat test pain as symptom not cause
    * app frameworks
  * test feedback
    * useless error msgs
    * long runs
      * throw out tests? (at least skip)
    * false negatives
      * erode confidence in tests
      * redundant coverage
      * poor mocking
      * slow tests
      * track failures, how long to fix, use to improve suites

### Thoughts

* very quick preso with lots of slides and points
* but a lot of tips and tricks, things to keep in mind to make tests better
* work on speed because less likely to skip things when it takes too long

# a machine state of mind

* @vaidehijoshi
* [Code](http://slides.com/vaidehijoshi/machinestateofmind)
* dont know what you're doing, but thats ok
* state machine
  * state, data, changes
* what looks like state machine?
  * state or status column
  * timestamps with null value
  * start_date and end_date
* directed graph
* acts as state machine
  * states
  * callbacks
  * block passed to state transition, only fires if succeed
  * guards

### Thoughts

* aasm vs workflow
* with start/end how to use state machine?
* tracking state transitions

# In the Name of Whiskey

* @juliaferraioli
* can i hug that?
  * image -> can hug?
* whiskey
  * managable, objective data
* feature vector
  * numeric values
  * matrix math
  * tensor = n dimensional array
* tensorflow
  * deferred execution
  * define compute graph
  * tensor object -> matrices , but eval
* k-means clustering
  * k = number of groupings
  * iterative to converge centers
  * choosing k important
  * initialization of centers is important
* tensorflow
  * fortran? just use docker image
* whiskey k-means
  * flavors grouping doesnt quite look like regional grouping
* neural network
  * input -> ??? -> output
  * hidden layer - guides for choosing, lots of math
  * each input to each neuron, to output
  * init each layer (again, initial state important)
  * how to optimize (each iter)
  * training, testing
  * accuracy
* lessons, goals
  * pronouncing scotch incorrectly
  * data collection is hard
  * 86 points not much
  * wrong data is still wrong
  * thinking in n-dimensions is brain-bending
  * bit.ly - k-means-scotch tensorflow-oss ff-nn learn-tensorflow gentle-intro-ml

### Thoughts

* no ruby interface for tensorflow (sound familliar), but yes python
* try TF for recommendation boost, offer 'rating', think about what tf would mean for ocr
* maybe a talk on something fun like playing a video game via NN learning?

# fold, paper, scisors - origami cut and fold problem

* @sailorhg - bubblesort zines
* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/sailorhg/fold-paper-scissors-ruby-on-ales-2016)
* tech and art
* paper folding algorithms - provable
* any polygonal shape with just one cut - proved
* fold so all cuts are all aligned on the same line
* angle bisector
  * if intersect - straight skeleton
  * shrink original shape along bisectors
  * stop when shrnk to point
  * two edges merge to line as its own
  * separate into two disjoint shapes, continue algorithm
* shoes + ruby geometry
* computational folding theory
* not all sets of edges fold flat
* extend inner skeleton to edges
* how to generalize
  * must meet shape edge at 90 degrees
  * every internal vertex - wont need them all
* mountain valley foldability
  * can detect in vs out folds
* can generate too many folds
* can be used for
  * folding solar panels
  * 3d modeling?

### Thoughts

* fun application of algorithm theory
* could be a fun project to turn into 3d app showing folds

# Crystal Programming Lang

* @leinweber
* Citus Data - sharding automated

* [Code](https://github.com/will/roa2016_crystal)
* crystal play - online browser for live workbook
* ruby inspired
* built on llvm
* fully self-hosted
* static method dispatch
* easy to link c
* classes are still open
* modules + mixins
* common idioms (?, trailing conditionals, ||=, parens, spec framework)
* tooling
* can chain things in to_procs
* union type (compiletime). methods downstream need to be defined (typewise) downstream.
* nil can be checked at compiletime
* explicit casting
* method overloading
* abstract classes, abstract methods
* touples
* Generics (parameterize types)
* macros
  * method template language, looks a lot like liquid
  * can shell out at compile time
* no orm yet...
* Linking against c code
  * since llvm, quite simple. just define interface
* regex pcre
* profiling c code - instruments on osx
* misc
  * structs (stack alloc), io (evented!), code formatter (built in), concurrency (channels + coroutines like go)
* crystal-lang.org/docs

### Thoughts

* seems like lang has been around for a while and is still very young
* compare to rust
* but, way of solving type problems pretty interesting

# when good software goes bad

* @reinh
* sotware fails alot
* culture - behavior, beliefs, values, symbols and meanings we share as a group of people
* quality - software that is valuable to someone
* failure - difference between expectation and observation
* process patterns
  1. oblivious - dont even know theres a process, not following any process. capable of solving own problem, and you are using it
  2. variable - we do whatever we feel like in the moment. poor adherence to process, depend on individuals. separates developer from user. blaming appears.
    * require great relation with customer, competant professionals, not solving a problem too big for team
    * myth - rockstar programmer - completely dependent on performance
    * only follow process when convenient
  3. routine - we follow routines (except when we dont). plan to solve all problems
    * depend on plans, managers to implement. exceptional cases are problem
    * problem cant be bigger than small team handle
    * myth - rockstar manager - repeatable, but not repeated. blindly follow process.
    * name magic - 'agile', 'tdd', 'lean' - imbue with powers just saying
  4. steering pattern - choose among routines by the results they produce
    * usually management training (not individual contrib)
    * processes not super well defined, but goals well defined. recover if process doesnt work
    * problem hard enough for simple routine to not work
    * some control/negotiate with externaliies.  can reject arbritrary schedule/constraint
  5. (+1more?) - 85% at variable, 1% at level 3, 0 at 4 or 5
* Cybernetic Control
  * feedback to make good choices, iteratively
  * inputs - resources, requirements, randomness
  * outputs - software, outputs
  * variable - no controller between inputs and outputs - software somehow comes out
  * controller - manages requirements - needs feedback from outputs
* nonlinear system
  * inputs dont correlate to outputs
  * humans really hard at predicting
* deal with nonlinear
  * governing actions - prioritizing.
  * act early, small, often.
  * if you can't see it, it doesnt exist - get visibility
  * if you cant understand it, you cant fix it
* models
  * Mythical Man Month - failure for lack of calendar time - make model explicit
  * make model explicit and share them
  * implicit - developers will do what i tell them.  i can add people to make it go faster. bugs occur at random. the more pressure, the faster they work. I know how to identify best developers
    * characteristic of variable orgs
* feedback/control systems needed at all models
  * control nonlinear effects
* better software - spend time thinking about people

### Thoughts

* great talk on process, types of process, etc.
* obvious that levels are a bit fluid
