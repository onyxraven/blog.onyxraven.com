# Organizational Complexity

## Networking

- global infrastructure (pops, regions, AZs)
- **transitive routing**, container services
  - transit gateway - ECMP support, multicast support, traffic is encrypted
    - no route propagation, needs static routes
    - can multi-region
    - use unique ASNs for route propagation
    - max 50 peering per TGW
    - accelerate site-to-site vpn can be enabled (not VGW though)
    - 5000 attachments
    - multiple route tables
  - public dns -> private IP is not supported over vpc peering
  - ecs / fargate bridge vs vpc modes
    - no bridge in fargate
- hybrid dns
  - route53 resolver, on prem dns
    - Through Resolver endpoints and conditional forwarding rules, you can resolve DNS queries between your on-premises resources and VPCs to create a hybrid cloud setup over VPN or Direct Connect (DX)
  - route53 private can be associated with vpc in other accounts
    - create association (two way, authorization from hosted zone), remove authorization after associated
- vpc connectivity
  - route table max 1000,
  - vpc max 125
  - dhcp option sets can be attached to multiple vpcs, each is immutable
- connectivity for onprem, colo, cloud
- traffic flows
- service endpoints
- gateway loadbalancer
  - custom routing, only VPC endpoints
  - can be multi region
- load balancers
  - source IPs app sees:
    - ALB/CLB = LB's ENIs. x-forwarded-for can be used
    - NLB by instance ID: IP of the client (proxy/rewritten)
    - NLB by IP, TCP/TLS: IP of the NLB ENIs
    - NLB by UDP, TCP_UDP: client ip (proxy/rewritten)
    - Proxy Protocol
    - NLB+VPC Endpoint or Global Accelerator: NLB ENIs
  - NLBs
    - no security groups
- privatelink
  - ipv4+tcp only
  - private dns
  - direct connect, vpn, vpc peering supported
- gateway endpoint
  - only certain services. prefix list in route table - not accessable outside vpc
- interface endpoint
  - one per az, uses privatelink
  - private DNS overrides default dns

## Security

- IAM/SSO
  - policy has 5k limit of policies, profiles, roles
- Route tables, security groups, NACLs
- KMS, ACM
  - S3 SSE-C - key provided at upload, only hash stored
  - max 4k encrypt in CMK
  - ACM - certificate foreach region. Cloudfront from US_EAST_1
- tools: cloudtrail, iam access analyzer, **securityhub**, inspector
  - config can detect unapproved amis, inspector for deployed applications
- cross-account access
- 3rd party Identity managers
- encryption strategies at rest and in transit
- centralized security and audit

## Reliability and Resilience

- RTO/RPO
- DR strategies: AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (CloudEndure), pilot light, warm standby, multisite
  - DRS - replication of block storage from onprem or cloud
    - agent, replicates to ec2 staging area, can select point in time
- backup / restore
- scaleup/scaleout options

## Multi-Account

- orgs and controltower
  - eventbridge events for lifecycle of accounts
- event notifications
- resource sharing across envs
  - resource access manager (RAM)
    - OU access
    - resource policies, even for some that dont have them
      - (aurora (clones), ec2 (reservations), licenses, route53 (resolver), vpc (ip lists and gateways))
- central logging / events
- governance
  - org policies for backup, tag, SCP
- lambda can assume roles in other accounts
- landing zone (control tower)
  - blueprints
  - management account: control tower, stacksets and service catalog
    - SSO, directory services
  - logging account (config, cloudtrail)
  - audit account (security, config)
    - config aggregate can collect data from multiple accounts
  - provisioned accounts (other)
  - suspended accounts, test and staging
- SCPs
  - service linked roles (by aws) arent affected by SCP
- SSO
  - assume role with web identity == facebook, openid etc. exchange for STS tokens
  - aws sso endpiont exchanges saml with STS

## Cost Optimization

- tools: trusted advisor, pricing calc, cost explorer, budgets
  - idle db (no connections in 7 days)
  - underutilized (< 5% p99 usage)
- purchasing options: RI, savings plan, spot
  - compute savings plan automatically apply, up to 66% savings, all regions
    - also fargate and lambda usage
  - instance savings plan for single region, single instance family, automatically apply
    - lowest price 72% savings, commit to individual instance families (eg m5)
  - rds and redshift support Reserved Instance
  - commit to $/hour
  - org/master can turn off sharing to accounts
- right-sizing: compute optimizer, **storage lens**
  - uses existing metrics - automatically suggests
- monitoring, tagging strategy
  - system manager, config don't natively add tags, but can detect
  - config can't deny actions - SCP can though
  - cloudformation resource tags can automate, and can be driven by service catalog

# Design for New Solutions

## Deployment Strategy

- IAC (cloudformation)
  - autoscaling group can specify AutoScalingRollingUpdate when a change has been made
- CICD
- Config Management (Systems Manager)
- application and upgrade of new services/features
- deploy/rollback
- managed services

## business continuity

- networking (route53, routing methods)
  - if no record is healthy, all records are healthy
  - failover records must be checked by public IP
  - alias record use 'evaluate target health', not regular healthcheck
  - healthcheck in first 5k of response
  - no ALIAS for EC2 instance records (use cname/a)
  - alias for domain apex/root
  - create alias to CNAME if target is also a CNAME
- disaster recovery solutions
- database replication
- testing

## security controls

- IAM, network, encryption
- credential management
- managed security services (shield, WAF, **guardduty**, **securityHub**)
  - shield protects r53, cloudfront, Global Accelerator
    - can't use self-signed certs for origin to cloudfront
  - shield advance includes elastic ips, alb, clb, nlb, waf, cost protections
- least privilege
- attack mitigation strategies
- patch management

## reliability

- storage replication - s3, rds, elasticache
- multi-az and multi-region
- autoscaling
- SNS, sqs, step functions
- quotas and limits
  - lambda concurrency - up to 3000 burst
  - edge can only run 10k RPS

## performance

- monitoring
- storage options
  - RDS: baseline maximum perf same as > 5tb
    - rds: scale to 64tb, 256k iops, 4gb bandwidth
    - SQL Server max 64k on nitro instances (m5+, r5+, z1+). others get 32k
    - oracle max 256k on r5b
  - EBS
    - baseline GP2 SSD is 3iops per GB (eg, 1tb = 3000iops), max 16000
    - gp2 baseline is higher than burst perf, about 12000 on a striped set
    - burst duration = credit blanace / (burst ops - 3\*storage in gp)
    - io1 max 50:1 iops, io2 max 500:1 - io1 require 10x bigger to get to 64k maximum
    - multi-attach only available to io1/2 on nitro, in same AZ
  - S3
    - read-after-write consistency
- instance families
- purpose-built dbs
- access patterns
- elastic architecture
- caching, buffering, replicas
- redshift queues
  - WLM - queue concurrency levels + superuser queue. maximum for all is 50 concurrency

# workload migration and modernization

## existing workloads for potential migration

- asset tracking (migration hub)
  - application discovery - agent vs agentless (vcenter)
  - hub tracks status of application migration, database migration
  - application migration service - convert and sync
- portfolio assessment, asset planning, prioritization
- evaluating 7 common migration strategies -
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/application-portfolio-assessment-guide/introduction.html
  - 6Rs
    - rehost - keep in tact, move in whole
    - replatform - minor changes, use migration tools
    - repurchase - new saas/license/off the shelf offerings from marketplace
    - refactor - use new tech
    - retain - leave in place
    - retire - remove it from prod
    - relocate - vmware on aws eg
- total cost of ownership

## optimal migration path

- data migration options (datasync, transfer family, snow family, transfer acceleration)
  - transfer family only for in/out of s3
    - can assign an elastic IP per AZ
  - snowball edge can't copy direct to glacier
  - snowmobile >10pb of data
  - snowball edge cluster for durability, not speed.
  - use multiple copy operations
- migration tools (application discovery service, application migration (cloudendure), server migration service)
- networking (directconnect, vpn, r53)
  - direct connect for onprem to vpc
    - private VIF can't reach vpc endpoints
      - advertises cidr, bgp peer ids
      - one vif -> 1 vgw -> one vpc
        - 10 vgw per dx gateway
        - 50 private vifs per gateway = 500 vpcs
        - 3 transit gatway for a transit vif
        - transit gateway => 20 DX gateways
        - tgw = 20 routes to onprem
      - needs bgp, bgp md5
    - gateway can be vgws & private vifs OR transit gateway & transit vifs (not both)
    - public vif can access all regions
    - 1,10,100gbps, VPN/vgw 1.25gbps
      - no autonegotiation,
      - LAGs active-active 4 connections
    - site to site vpn needs a public DX interface
  - client vpn - not split tunnel by default
  - path selection in routing
    - most specific/longest prefix
    - static route entries including site-to-site
    - vpc propogated routes
    - bgp propogated from direct-connect
    - bgp propogated from vpn
- identity (sso, **directory service**)
  - self managed AD -- AWS SSO, via 2 way trust (managed AD and selfmanaged) or AD connector (redirects request without
    caching)
- db migration (DMS, schema conversion tool)
  - redshift, replication must be in same account+region. uses s3
  - no cross-region
- governance tools (controltower, orgs)

## new architecture

- compute (ec2, beanstalk)
- containers (ECS, EKS, fargate, ECR)
- storage (EBS, EFS, FSx, s3, volume gateway)
  - storage volume gateway - upload buffer = (application throughput - bandwidth*compression) * duration of writes =
    upload buffer - eg `((40 MB/sec) - (12 MB/sec _ 2)) _ (12 hours \* 3600 seconds/hour) = 691200 megabytes`
    - at least 150gb
    - cache storage at 1.1x upload buffer
    - new disks needed when changing
    - remember gigabytes vs gigabits
    - 10mbps internet ~ 100gb per day, 1gbps ~12tb per day
  - gateway offers s3, fsx, cached and stored, tape based
    - 1024tb (32x32) cached size volume, 512tb (16\*32) stored volume
    - file gateway (s3) nfs, smb
  - efs - 10+gb/s
    - general performance mode / bursting throughput, vs max io mode with higher latency
    - provisioned throughput mode vs automatic/bursting (scales with size). adjust down 24 hours
  - s3
    - replication - Replication TIme Control can notify > 15 minutes of replication
- databases (ddb, opensearch (elasticsearch), rds, self managed)
  - ddb strongly consistent read 4kb = 1unit, eventually consistent 4kb=0.5unit, transactional 2unit
    - write = 1kb = 1 unit, or transactional 2 unit
  - RDS oracle doesn't support many features, including multi-tenant, RAC, auditing, vault
    - non-rds use oracle recovery manager
    - rds uses Transparent Data Encryption to storage (oracle and ms-sql)
  - RDS Data API - only RDS serverless
  - RDS Proxy for lambdas

## modernization

- serverless
  - lambda verisons are immutable, aliases mutable. env vars part of version
  - provisioned (prestarted lambdas) vs reserved (maximums)
  - event source mapping
- containers (ecs, eks, fargate)
  - ecs - bridge mode only available on ec2 instances
- storage (s3, efs)
- databases (ddb, aurora serverless, elasticache)
- integration (sqs, sns, eventbridge, step functions)
  - sqs is not an input into step function
  - step function - mechanical turk does not integrate natively
    - standard - lifetime of 1 year. express is 5 minutes
  - sqs fifo 300 operations per second, read in batches of 10 (3000 messages)
    - message group and deduplication ids - group guarantees order within
    - must have .fifo suffix
    - no delay queue
- kinesis
  - 1mb/1k writes per shard
  - 5 reads per second, each 10k records or 10mb
  - each shard max total/average data read rate of 2mb/s - if 10mb, wait 5 seconds
- swf
  - activity task, worker, decider
  - 1 year runtime
  - external signals, launch child flows, complex decisions
  -
